# `azalea-pumpkin-extractor`

A slimmed-down fork of PumpkinMC's Extractor Fabric mod, only targetting the latest Minecraft snapshot.

This was created for use in [Azalea](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea)'s code generator, so features that aren't necessary for that purpose will not be maintained and might be removed in the future.

## Usage

```sh
./gradlew runServer
# generated files are now in pumpkin_extractor_output
```
